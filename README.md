**Industrial and interface design: [Liberiam (Mary Timofeeva)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marija-timofeeva-184484382/)**

**New version with touch screen V5, coming soon )**



This is a very compact computer case that I made for my NAS on SSD 2.5 drives with a RAID controller.
The model was created for laser cutting from sheet material (I used acrylic of different colors, white 9016, black RAL 9005 and ultramarine RAL 5002).
The model was created in Fusion 360.

**Version V4**

The folder contains two Corel Draw files and each part separately in dxf format. For laser cutting I used 5mm and 3mm acrylic. You can use any solid sheet plastic in these sizes.
You can order laser cutting according to these drawings in your city from any company that provides these services. It is not expensive )

**Computer hardware and case parts**

1. Any mini-ITX motherboard will do. Check the height of the cooling system. And at least one PCI-Express x16 for the RAID controller. I used the board ASRock J4005B-ITX

16. In order not to clog the case space with a bunch of wires, it is better to make a power cable for SATA drives yourself. It's easy to do, all you need are [**wires 18AWG (yellow, black 2x, red, I had 10 meters to spare)**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mqA43wY) and [**connectors (With 180 Cap).**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mPAv6ti)
