# Mini PC Box v4

Buy me a coffee https://paypal.me/StanislavTimofeev       )

This is a very compact computer case that I made for my NAS on SSD 2.5 drives with a RAID controller.
The model was created for laser cutting from sheet material (I used acrylic of different colors, white 9016, black RAL 9005 and ultramarine RAL 5002).
The model was created in Fusion 360.

The folder contains two Corel Draw files and each part separately in dxf format. For laser cutting I used 5mm and 3mm acrylic. You can use any solid sheet plastic in these sizes.
You can order laser cutting according to these drawings in your city from any company that provides these services. It is not expensive )
